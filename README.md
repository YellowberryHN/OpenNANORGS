# OpenNANORGS

A (very poor) .NET 7.0 reimplementation of Symantec's 2006
University Programming Competition virtual nano-organism simulator.

*A project born out of intrigue, minor obsession, frustration and inspriration.*

## Story

If you'll indulge me for a moment, there's a bit of a story behind this,
and I'd feel bad if I didn't share it with the world.

Hi, I'm [Yellowberry](https://github.com/YellowberryHN), and this is
the story of [OpenNANORGS](https://github.com/YellowberryHN/OpenNANORGS).

[Many moons ago](# "apparently sometime around 1384988829"), a younger me
was looking for a science fair project, but, I wanted to do something special,
something different. I had been interested in programming for about 3-5 years
at this point, and I wanted to see if I could combine my interest in programming
with a cool science fair project. I was scouring the internet until a project on
some random [science fair project idea][1] website caught my eye. The premise had
me immediately intrigued, and although it sounded hard, I knew I could at least
try to work with it. I downloaded the project files and immediately got to work.

After digging through the included documentation, I realized this was going to be
much more difficult than I anticipated, and I started having my doubts. As someone
who had up until that point only had experience with very high level languages like
Lua, it was difficult to wrap my head around.
